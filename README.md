### cloud-security

This directory contains configurations, Terraform scripts, and policy files for implementing security across cloud environments, specifically for AWS. It includes setup for IAM roles, security groups, logging, and compliance checks.

- **Purpose**: To ensure robust cloud security configurations and enable monitoring for compliance.
- **Key Files**: 
  - Terraform configurations for AWS resources
  - Security policies and compliance scripts

### emulation-attack

The `emulation-attack` directory includes tools and scripts for setting up and executing attack simulations. This directory is useful for testing detection and response capabilities in a controlled environment.

- **Purpose**: To test security configurations and monitoring solutions by simulating realistic cyber-attack scenarios.
- **Key Files**: 
  - Attack simulation scripts
  - Configuration files for running attack scenarios

### quasar-agent

`quasar-agent` is configured for the Quasar security agent, focusing on system monitoring and threat detection. This directory includes Docker configurations, scripts, and agent-specific rules.

- **Purpose**: To deploy and manage the Quasar agent across systems for enhanced monitoring and incident detection.
- **Key Files**:
  - Dockerfiles and setup scripts for the agent
  - Configuration and rules files

### soar-stack

The `soar-stack` directory is dedicated to the Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) configuration. It integrates different security tools for automated alerting, incident management, and workflow automation.

- **Purpose**: To automate and manage responses to security events using integrations with tools like Shuffle, Wazuh, and others.
- **Key Files**:
  - Configuration files for SOAR workflows
  - Integration scripts for connecting various security tools

### wazuh-compose

This directory contains Docker Compose files for setting up a multi-node Wazuh cluster environment. It enables centralized security monitoring and log analysis with high availability.

- **Purpose**: To deploy a scalable, multi-node Wazuh setup for centralized security event monitoring and analysis.
- **Key Files**:
  - Docker Compose files for Wazuh multi-node setup
  - Configuration files for Wazuh components (manager, dashboard, indexer)
